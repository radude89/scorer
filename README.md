# Talk Abstract
As iOS developers, we often paused our work to wait for the “backend guys” to finish their APIs. Or to develop against mocks, which in most of the cases aren’t accurate and change quite often.   

There is enormous power in Swift and it’s easy to go from a frontend to a full-stack developer.   

With server-side Swift, we can build a bridge between both worlds, sharing models, code and frameworks. Swift on the server is production ready!
We can develop a feature from top to bottom, breaking the traditional way of splitting teams into backend and frontend.
But which framework to choose? Let’s explore the pros and cons of some known web frameworks. Vapor, for example, uses at maximum the functional programming paradigm, has great performance and the code is deployed very easy.   

After this talk, you will learn how to take advantage of the true power of Swift, upgrading yourself to a Full-Stack Swift Developer.
